## Details
Wildpeppers is a project I made for fun between 2019 and 2020 to experiment with Gooogle Firebase. Wildpeppers Android is the Android app front-end that enables users to download wallpapers for their phones from a Firebase database.

## Origin
It originates from [probelalkhan/wallpaper-app-admin](https://github.com/probelalkhan/wallpaper-app-admin).

## Name Meaning
Wildpeppers wallpapers adopts the [Lawnchair launcher](github.com/LawnchairLauncher)'s naming approach, just like ["Emulair emulator"](github.com/Emulair) does, therefore the name is nothing more than a homophone for the kind of software that Wildpeppers is (a wallpapers downloading app).

## Disclaimer
The project doesn't work properly and it's not actually available on Google Play ://. Lawnchair is not associated with Wildpeppers.
